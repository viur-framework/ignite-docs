		<p>
			Ignite is a library of different interface components.
			Components are self-contained objects.
			You can think of components as custom elements that incorporate specific semantics, styling, and behaviour.
			Every component is stored in its LESS file â€” <code>button.less</code>, <code>form.less</code> etc.
			All LESS files are categorized in the <code>ignite.less</code>.
		</p>

		<p>Component driven development offers several benefits when reading and writing HTML and CSS:</p>
		<ul class="is-list">
			<li>
				It helps to distinguish between the classes for the root of the component, descendent elements, and
				modifications.
			</li>
			<li>It keeps the specificity of selectors low.</li>
			<li>It helps to decouple presentation semantics from document semantics.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Every component has to create its own namespace to separate its enclosed specifics from the rest of the
			page, like <code>.input-</code> or <code>.footer-</code>.
			Namespacing should be made at a descriptive, functional level.
		</p>

	<section class="section">
		<h2 class="headline docs-headline">Page styling</h2>
		<p>
			Prefer components over page level styles.
			Pages should largely be reusing the general component level styles, such as <code>.btn</code> or
			<code>.wrap</code>.
			Page level name-spaces however can be helpful for overriding generic components in very specific contexts.
			Page level overrides should be minimal and under a single page level class nest.
		</p>
	</section>


	<section class="section">
		<h2 class="headline docs-headline">Nesting</h2>
		<p>
			Avoid nesting whenever possible.
			Nesting makes it harder to tell at a glance where css selector optimizations can be made.
			Although in the name (cascading style sheets) cascading can introduce unnecessary performance overhead for
			applying styles.
		</p>
	</section>


	<section class="section">
		<h2 class="headline docs-headline">Component parts</h2>
		<pre>.componentname-partname</pre>
		<p>
			A component part is a class that is attached to a descendent node of a component.
			It's responsible for applying presentation directly to the descendant on behalf of a particular component.
		</p>
	</section>


	<section class="section">
		<h2 class="headline docs-headline">Component variation</h2>
		<pre>.componentname--variationname</pre>
		<p>
			A component variation is a class that modifies the presentation of the base component in some form, e.g.
			color, direction or size.
			The class should be included in the HTML <strong>in addition</strong> to the base component class.
		</p>
	</section>


	<section class="section">
		<h2 class="headline docs-headline">Syntax</h2>
		<ul class="is-list">
			<li>Components, component parts and component variations are writen in lowercase.</li>
			<li>Component parts are separated by a hyphen.</li>
			<li>Component variation names are separated from the component name by two hyphens.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>


	<section class="section">
		<h2 class="headline docs-headline">Generic elements</h2>
		<p>
			Generic elements are built as
			<a href="http://lesscss.org/functions/#misc-functions-default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
			   title="LESS Reference: Mixin">less mixin function</a>,
			so they have to be initialized before use.
		</p>

		{% call codeSnippet("less") %}
			.table {
			  .genericTable(); // ignite mixin

			  width: 100%; // custom styling
			}
		{% endcall %}

		<p>The code above initializes the table. Now you can use it with the namespace <code>.table-</code>.</p>
